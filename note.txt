Data type in javascript:
dynamic data type:
javascript supports dynamic data type because depending on the value of variable js determines what type of data it is. Thats why it is also called  dynamicaly programming langugage.

Primitive and non primitive data types:
there are 6 primitive data types and one known non-primitive data type we know so far that is object.
the main difference is that if we change one object the change will be reflected to other because they both have same refernce. 
but this is not the case with primitive data types;

Falsy and truthy:

falsy:
false
0 is falsy value;
empty string is falsy;
undefined;
not a number;NAN;



-----------------

truthy:
true
any number positive or negative is truthy
string is truthy;
any string including single whitespace,'0';
empty array is truthy;
empty object is also truthy;
anything else that is not falsy will be truthy

undefined vs null:

 undefined:
  1) varaible value not assigned;
  2) function but did not write return;
  3) just wrote return but does not return anything
  4)parameter that isnt passed;
  5)property that doesnot exist in an object;
  6)accessing array element out of range;
  7)accessing deleted element in an array;
  8)explicitly set value to undefined;

  null:
  1) expilicitly set a value to null;
